# PolaBeax-Lua

PolaBeax is an easy-to-use exploit which allow you to run different commands ( not LUA ) which already created by me!

How to import it into the game?

First, execute this script ```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OriChanEzScript/PolaBeax-Lua/main/MAIN-API.lua"))()```
Second, the game will ask you to inject the script, click ```Yes```
After that, wait the script to complete the injection
Finally, you can see it pop-up a UI with command bar and an execute button. Here you go! Now we will continue to the commands and functions!

Commands and their functions!

```WalkSpeed(int)``` - Set your WalkSpeed to the given value!
```JumpHeight(int)``` - Set your JumpHeight to the given value!
```ViewInventory(player_name)``` - Allow you to view other players inventory.

More commands will be update soon!
